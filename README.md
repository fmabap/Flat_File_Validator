# Flat File Validator

This tool is a quick and dirty flat file validator.

 You have to enter the file structure as JSON an the file content. You will receive the validation result as JSON and for each record or each record type (depending on your settings) a table with the records splitted into the fields.
 Errors are marked in red and you can find the error in the tooltip of the field.
 
 ## JSON file format
 You can find JSON file format (example data) when you click in the tool on the "Fill with demo data" button
 There is currently no validation of it (quick and dirty). So errors will occur in the console if something wents wrong.
